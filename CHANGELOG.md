# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.6] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- Support for Python 3.13 (all 89 tests pass)
- Session-scoped pytest fixtures in conftest.py for all test data files
- Python version classifiers (3.9-3.13) to pyproject.toml

### Changed
- Updated GitHub Actions to test on Python 3.13
- Centralized test data loading via fixtures (18 session-scoped fixtures)
- Updated test files to use conftest fixtures instead of direct load_data() calls
- Improved test efficiency through fixture reuse

### Removed
- Redundant runtime dependencies: typing, setuptools, scipy (indirect via lifelines/statsmodels)
- Redundant dev dependency: pathlib (built-in since Python 3.4)
- Duplicate test setup code in test_binary_consequences.py
- Redundant test files: test_load_test_data.py, test_non_dcurves_code.py (4 tests)
- Duplicate plotting test files: test_optional_gridlines.py, test_plot_saving.py (5 tests)
- Split large test_plotting.py into test_plotting_core.py and test_plotting_options.py for clarity
- Dead code: _validate.py (195 lines of commented validation functions)
- Dead code: load_test_data.py from main package (moved to tests/load_test_data.py)
- Commented code block in dca.py (18 lines of unused statistical calculations)
- Result: 78 tests (from 89) in 13 files (from 16), -263 lines of dead code from package

## [1.1.5] - 2025-07-11

### Changed
- Moved `images/` directory to `public/` for better project organization.
- Removed `.tox` and `.idea` directories from version control and updated `.gitignore`.

### Fixed
- Updated statsmodels dependency from `==0.14.4` to `>=0.14.5` to fix compatibility with scipy>=1.14.0. The issue was caused by statsmodels using scipy's private `_lazywhere` function which was removed in scipy 1.14.0. This fix ensures dcurves works with the latest scipy versions.
- Fixed missing data files in package distribution. Added `dcurves/data/*.csv` to package includes to ensure test data files are properly distributed with the package.

## [1.1.4] - 2025-05-22

### Added
* `linewidths` parameter in plotting (`plot_graphs`, `_plot_net_benefit`, `_plot_net_intervention_avoided`).  Accepts either a single float applied to all models or a per-model list.
* Comprehensive unit-tests for linewidth handling and updated marker/colour logic.
* `docs/WORKFLOW.md` â€“ end-to-end contributor guide.

### Changed
* `VALID_MARKERS` de-duplicated and centralised.
* README expanded with badges, table-of-contents and clearer examples.
* Jupyter notebooks folder renamed to `notebooks/`.
* CI workflow (`uv-actions.yml`) simplified; dev dependencies installed via `.[dev]`.
* Dynamic version retrieval in `dcurves/__init__.py` via `importlib.metadata` (removes hard-coded version string).
* Development dependencies consolidated under `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`.

### Removed
* Legacy files: `.pylintrc`, `.coverage`, `poetry.lock`.
