Decision Curve Analysis Plotting Module

This module provides functions for creating decision curve analysis plots.

Imported Functions:
    plot_graphs: Main function to generate and display decision curve analysis graphs.
    _plot_net_benefit: Helper function to plot net benefit curves.
    _plot_net_intervention_avoided: Helper function to plot net intervention avoided curves.

These functions are used to visualize the performance of prediction models or diagnostic tests
across different threshold probabilities in clinical decision-making scenarios.
